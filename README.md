# K-means-Tissue
Tissue type classification with k-means in matlab (simplified)

Very simple matlab prototype of k-means classification of tissue, designed as part of H&E stained biopsy classification algorithms. Later, more advanced versions were written in C, Python, and Java and leveraged tissue classes for stromal, epithelial, and nuclei identification. k=4 tends to work well, but consistent results across biopsies with variable stains requires more advanced algorithms. Also, computationally inefficient approach.
